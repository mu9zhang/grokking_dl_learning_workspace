    "1. In industry, deep learning is used to solve practical tasks in a variety of fields such as computer vision (image), natural language\n",
    "   processing (text), and automatic speech recognition (audio). In short, deep learning is a subset of methods in the machine learning\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Machine learning is a subfield of computer science wherein machines learn to perform tasks for which they were not explicitly programmed.\n",
    "   In short, machines observe a pattern and attempt to imitate it in some way that can be either direct or indirect. I mention direct and\n",
